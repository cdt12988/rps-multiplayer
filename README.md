## Game Features

### Players

The game allows up to two players to join in at a time.  Simply type in whatever display name you would like and click “Play”.  Once two players have joined, the game will start with the first player.

### Gameplay

Each player takes turns selecting rock, paper or scissors.  Neither player is aware of what the other has selected until both selections are locked in.  At which point, the winner (if any) is revealed!  The results are temporarily displayed and a new round begins immediately.

### Game Tracking

The game will keep track of each players total wins and losses while they remain in the game.  The app can sense as soon as one of the players leaves and will immediately update the game display while waiting for a new player to join.

### Chat System

The game has a built-in chat system which allows players to chat in real-time with one another while playing.

## Development Notes

### Languages, Frameworks and Tools

This game uses HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery with an emphasis on Firebase to obtain realtime database responses and user disconnects.
